I made this project to deal with all the New Year's resolutions, thal lasts only for a couple of weeks, at the longest.

- Want to get a sixpack? - Do some excersise for it for at least [22 days in a row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6PhNnlb-14)
- Want get better at drawing? - Draw every day for at least a month! (Inktober)
- Want that private island? Err... well, you've got my point.

It's a calendar-like web app, where you can easily set your goal's continuity, and see how you are progressing!

- Easy login with Google
